# Log Entry

Today I installed apache2 and w3m onto my vm. 

I was able to rename the `index.html` file and create a nano file. I added the basic code provided from the textbook but hope to add to the code when I have more time to refresh my html skills.
I originally had some confusion when I entered the command for the nano file with `index.html` after renaming the original. In my head, I was just opening the file that I renamed and it took me a second to realize I was actually creating a new file.


I had some trouble viewing the webpage in Google Chrome but finally figured out that I was copying the internal IP from my Google Cloud console instead of the external IP. Once I made that correction, I was able to view the page without any issues. 

Even with the issues I had to work through, this was still the easiest lecture I've watched all semester. I'm glad that I'm finally getting the hang of using the vm.
