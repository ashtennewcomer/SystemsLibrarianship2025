# Log Entry

**February 05, 2025**

Today I watched the video on logging/documenting with Git and GitHub.

I learned the command `date +%F` which will automatically return the current date in a year-month-day format. 

I can also use the same command to create and name a file by running `touch $(date +%F).md`.
This same command can be used to create a nano file by replacing `touch` with `nano` so that it reads `nano $(date %F).md`. 

This command will be usedful in the future as I regularly create journal entries and log my progress throughout the course.
